The client.rs file contains one posssible instantiation of a Pung client application.

In this particular case, our objective is only to measure performance, so 
the client application does not have a GUI nor does it accept user input directly.

The client.rs file can easily be modified to build a "useful" app that
interface with a human being and allows for user input, dialing, etc.

The server.rs file, while also written with the objective of measuring performance,
is likely sufficient as is (or with minor modifications), since all the meaningful
functionality is implemented client-side.
